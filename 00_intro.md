### Intro

While going tru this training you will develop `online store`. Each next task will append some functionality or flexibility to it; 

Each task has a description and materials, it doesn't mean that you should read this or only this materials,
Â you are free to 'google' topics and select the most preferable content.
 
### Process 
A trainee must read and understand all materials related to the task and then complete all requirements from the task file.
After finishing that, a trainee must set 75% for particular task as a task progress and open pull request on Github. 
A link to the pull request must be sent to the trainer via Email or Skype. 
The trainer performs the code review and changes task progress percentage. 
The trainer sets 100% if everything is okay or the code contains minor mistakes. If the code requires important updates 
 the trainer can set 85%, 70%, etc. (depending on the number of mistakes). 
 A trainee must update code according to the comments from the code review and then inform his/her trainer that additional code review is required in the scope of the same pull request. 

### Administrative part
A trainee is obligated to inform his trainer about vacations or other activities, which will stop training process for 1 week and more. If there is no obstacles, then it is advised to complete at least one task per week (depends on the task scope). If a trainee is assigned on a project, then he/she should work on the training in his/her own time. Training must be completed in < 3 months. If training takes > 3 months, then situation will be reviewed individually (continue or stop the training and find the cause of a slow progress). 
If a trainee has difficulties, then he/she can ask the trainer for advice or a hint (only about the task itself). The final task is the end of the training. Basing on this task the trainer forms feedback for stakeholders, therefore a trainee works on it without any help.
